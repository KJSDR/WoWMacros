And now my mouseover macros + a wild charge macro that lets you use it as mouseover and have it work normally at the same time:
 
#showtooltip 
/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] rejuvenation
 
#showtooltip 
/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] regrowth
 
#showtooltip 
/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] remove corruption
 
#showtooltip 
/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] thorns
 
I have target party1, party2, party3 keybinds as well I often use when I want to heal/cleanse my teammates  
 
#showtooltip Wild Charge
/cast [@mouseover,exists,help,stance:0] [@target,stance:0,help] Wild Charge
/cast [stance:1/2,@mouseover,exists,harm][stance: 2,@target,exists,harm] Wild Charge
/cast [stance:1/2/3] Wild Charge
/cast wild charge
 
My rake macro to find people in stealth:
 
#showtooltip
/cleartarget [dead]
/targetenemy [noharm]
/cast Rake
 
Incap roar macro to avoid breaking it with auto attack:
 
#showtooltip Incapacitating Roar
/use Incapacitating Roar
/stopattack
 
Convoke macro: 
 
#showtooltip convoke the spirits
/use Forged Aspirant's Badge of Ferocity
/cast !Convoke the Spirits
 
Cancelform macro
 
/cancelform
 
Shadowmeld macro to make you prowl at the same time (more safe to get the rake stun)
 
#showtooltip shadowmeld
/cast prowl
/use !shadowmeld
 
If you are playing with a paladin on your team you should have a macro that can cancel BoP and BoF before they get stolen by a mage, I think stealth is a nice ability to do this with if you 
 
/cast prowl
/cancelaura Blessing of Protection 
/cancelaura Blessing of Freedom
 
New tww macros:
 
#showtooltip 
/cast [stance:1] rake; [stance:2] Mangle

/cast [known:102359] Mass Entanglement; [known:102793,@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
